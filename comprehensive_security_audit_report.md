# Comprehensive Security Audit Report - NightScan Project

**Date:** 2025-07-10  
**Auditor:** Security Analysis System  
**Project:** NightScan Wildlife Detection System

## Executive Summary

This security audit has identified several security vulnerabilities across the NightScan codebase. While the project has implemented various security measures, there are critical areas that require immediate attention to ensure the application is production-ready and secure against common attack vectors.

## Security Vulnerabilities by Category

### 1. Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities

#### **CRITICAL - Insecure Session Management**
- **Location:** `/secure_auth.py` (lines 129-169)
- **Issue:** Session data stored in memory dictionary instead of secure session store
- **Risk:** Session hijacking, session fixation attacks
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
```python
# Line 130: self.sessions = {}  # In production, use Redis
```
**Recommendation:** Implement Redis-based session storage as indicated in the comment.

#### **HIGH - Missing CSRF Token Validation**
- **Location:** `/api_v1.py` - Multiple endpoints
- **Issue:** Several API endpoints don't enforce CSRF protection
- **Risk:** Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks
- **Severity:** HIGH
**Recommendation:** Ensure all state-changing endpoints use `@require_csrf` decorator.

#### **HIGH - Weak Password Requirements**
- **Location:** `/config.py` (line 46)
- **Issue:** Minimum password length set to only 10 characters
- **Risk:** Brute force attacks
- **Severity:** HIGH
```python
password_min_length: int = 10
```
**Recommendation:** Increase to at least 12 characters and add complexity requirements.

### 2. SQL Injection Risks

#### **MEDIUM - Potential SQL Injection in Search**
- **Location:** `/api_v1.py` (line 844)
- **Issue:** Using ILIKE with user input without proper parameterization
- **Risk:** SQL injection through species filter
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
```python
query = query.filter(Detection.species.ilike(f"%{species_filter}%"))
```
**Recommendation:** Use SQLAlchemy's proper parameter binding.

#### **LOW - Safe SQL Usage**
- **Location:** Most database queries
- **Issue:** Project generally uses SQLAlchemy ORM correctly
- **Risk:** Low
- **Severity:** LOW
**Note:** Good practice observed in most queries.

### 3. XSS and CSRF Vulnerabilities

#### **HIGH - CSP Allows Unsafe Inline Scripts**
- **Location:** `/web/app.py` (lines 69-70)
- **Issue:** Content Security Policy allows 'unsafe-inline' for scripts and styles
- **Risk:** XSS attacks through inline scripts
- **Severity:** HIGH
```python
"script-src": "'self' 'unsafe-inline'",  # Allow inline scripts for forms
"style-src": "'self' 'unsafe-inline'",   # Allow inline styles
```
**Recommendation:** Remove 'unsafe-inline' and use nonces or hashes for necessary inline content.

#### **MEDIUM - Inconsistent CSRF Protection**
- **Location:** Multiple Flask routes
- **Issue:** Not all forms and API endpoints consistently use CSRF tokens
- **Risk:** CSRF attacks
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
**Recommendation:** Enable CSRF protection globally and exempt only safe endpoints.

### 4. Insecure Data Storage

#### **CRITICAL - Hardcoded Secrets in Code**
- **Location:** Multiple files based on grep results
- **Issue:** Potential hardcoded passwords and API keys
- **Risk:** Credential exposure
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
**Recommendation:** All secrets must be moved to environment variables.

#### **HIGH - Weak Encryption Key Management**
- **Location:** `/secure_secrets.py` (lines 25-29)
- **Issue:** Encryption key generated and printed to console
- **Risk:** Key exposure in logs
- **Severity:** HIGH
```python
print(f"⚠️  Generated new encryption key. Store this securely:")
print(f"   NIGHTSCAN_ENCRYPTION_KEY={base64.urlsafe_b64encode(key).decode()}")
```
**Recommendation:** Use secure key management service, never print keys to console.

### 5. File Upload Security Issues

#### **MEDIUM - File Type Validation**
- **Location:** `/secure_uploads.py`
- **Issue:** File type validation relies on client-provided MIME types
- **Risk:** Malicious file uploads
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
**Note:** Good implementation with magic bytes validation as fallback
**Recommendation:** Always validate file content, not just extension/MIME type.

#### **LOW - Good Path Traversal Protection**
- **Location:** `/secure_uploads.py` (lines 157-165)
- **Issue:** None - Good security implementation
- **Risk:** Low
- **Severity:** LOW
```python
if not str(file_path.resolve()).startswith(str(self.upload_dir.resolve())):
    return False, "Access denied"
```
**Note:** Excellent path traversal protection implemented.

### 6. API Security

#### **HIGH - Missing Rate Limiting on Critical Endpoints**
- **Location:** `/api_v1.py` - login endpoints
- **Issue:** Rate limiting not applied to authentication endpoints
- **Risk:** Brute force attacks
- **Severity:** HIGH
**Recommendation:** Apply strict rate limiting to login/auth endpoints.

#### **MEDIUM - CORS Configuration**
- **Location:** `/security_headers.py` (lines 91-96)
- **Issue:** CORS allows credentials with configurable origins
- **Risk:** Cross-origin attacks if misconfigured
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
```python
response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Credentials'] = 'true'
```
**Recommendation:** Carefully validate allowed origins, avoid wildcards.

### 7. Dependency Vulnerabilities

#### **HIGH - Outdated Dependencies**
- **Location:** `/requirements.txt`
- **Issue:** Several dependencies may have known vulnerabilities
- **Risk:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities
- **Severity:** HIGH
**Specific concerns:**
- Flask 3.1.1 (check for latest security patches)
- Pillow 11.2.1 (check for security updates)
**Recommendation:** Run `pip audit` and update all dependencies with security patches.

### 8. Secrets Management

#### **CRITICAL - Environment Variable Exposure**
- **Location:** `/secure_secrets.py`
- **Issue:** Secrets printed to console during initialization
- **Risk:** Credential leakage in logs
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
**Recommendation:** Never print secrets, use secure logging practices.

#### **MEDIUM - Good Secret Encryption**
- **Location:** `/secure_secrets.py`
- **Issue:** None - Good implementation of secret encryption
- **Risk:** Low when properly configured
- **Severity:** LOW
**Note:** Good practice with encrypted secret storage.

### 9. SSL/TLS Configuration

#### **MEDIUM - HSTS Configuration**
- **Location:** `/security_headers.py` (line 42)
- **Issue:** HSTS enabled with good settings
- **Risk:** Low
- **Severity:** LOW
```python
response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload'
```
**Note:** Good HSTS implementation.

#### **HIGH - Force HTTPS Not Consistently Enforced**
- **Location:** Various configuration files
- **Issue:** HTTPS enforcement depends on configuration
- **Risk:** Man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Severity:** HIGH
**Recommendation:** Always force HTTPS in production.

### 10. Input Validation Issues

#### **CRITICAL - Dangerous Function Usage**
- **Location:** Based on grep results for eval/exec
- **Issue:** Potential use of dangerous functions
- **Risk:** Remote code execution
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
**Recommendation:** Never use eval() or exec() with user input.

#### **MEDIUM - Good Input Sanitization**
- **Location:** `/api_v1.py` - file upload handling
- **Issue:** None - Good filename sanitization
- **Risk:** Low
- **Severity:** LOW
```python
sanitized_filename = sanitize_filename(file.filename)
```
**Note:** Good practice observed.

## Compliance Considerations
- GDPR: Ensure proper data encryption and user consent
- PCI DSS: If processing payments, additional security required
- OWASP Top 10: Address all relevant vulnerabilities

## Conclusion

The NightScan project has implemented several good security practices, but critical vulnerabilities remain that must be addressed before production deployment. The most urgent issues involve session management, secrets handling, and dependency updates. With the recommended improvements, the application can achieve a robust security posture suitable for production use.

**Risk Level: HIGH - Not recommended for production use until critical issues are resolved**
