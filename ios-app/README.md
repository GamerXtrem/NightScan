# NightScan iOS App

This folder contains a barebones React Native application for iOS. It can also be
extended to support Android.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with `npm install` then start the Metro server:

```bash
cd ios-app
npm install
npm run ios
```

This assumes you have the React Native CLI and Xcode installed on your machine.
