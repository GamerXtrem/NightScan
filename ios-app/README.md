# NightScan iOS App

This folder contains a React Native application for iOS.
It provides a basic navigation setup with a home screen followed by a bottom tab
interface. The tabs include the map, the detection list and a scan view.
Additional placeholders can be filled in with authentication and settings.
The application can also be extended to support Android.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the app using the React Native CLI:

```bash
cd ios-app
npm install
npm run ios
```

This assumes you have the React Native CLI and Xcode installed on your machine.
