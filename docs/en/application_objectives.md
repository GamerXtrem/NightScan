# Application Goals and User Experience

This document summarizes the main objectives of NightScan and the target user experience. Refer to it when planning features or refining the design.

## Application Goals

1. **Easy access to detections**
   - Display an interactive map with every detection (audio or photo) gathered by field sensors.
   - Provide a chronological list of the latest observations with the key information (species, time, location).
2. **Quick review and notifications**
   - Receive real-time alerts whenever a new detection is processed.
   - Filter the data (by species or geographical area) to immediately show relevant results.
3. **Sharing and export**
   - Allow detections to be shared by e-mail or exported (CSV/KMZ) for later analysis. A **Export CSV** button on the list screen lets users share everything at once.

## Target User Experience

- **Audience**: wildlife photographers, amateur naturalists, researchers or anyone who wants to track nocturnal fauna.
- **Interface**: clean design with a bottom navigation bar to access the map, detection list, filters and settings.
- **Usage**: familiar gestures (pinch to zoom, scroll, pull to refresh) so the application remains intuitive on both iOS and Android.
- **Simplicity first**: users quickly see when and where animals were detected without needing to open the raw media (photos or sounds).
