# NightScan

NightScan is an experiment in training neural networks to recognize night-time animals.
The project is organized into two main folders:

- **Audio Training/** – tools for preparing audio clips, generating spectrograms and training models to classify animal sounds.
- **Picture Training/** – scripts for building image datasets and training image recognition models.

For a quick overview of how to set up and run the audio workflow, see **Manuel.txt** at the repository root.
