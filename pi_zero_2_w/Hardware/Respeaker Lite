Powered by XMOS XU316 AI Sound and Audio chipset, this dev board excels in audio processing with its integrated dual microphone array, ideal for speech recognition and voice control. Featuring advanced onboard audio front-end algorithms, the XU316 chip provides interference cancellation, echo cancellation, and noise suppression. It supports I2S and USB connections and is compatible with Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 (Sense), Adafruit QT Py, Raspberry Pi, and PC.

Features
Dual Microphone Array for Far-Field Voice Capture: The 2 high performance digital microphones capture and extract far-field speech and voice (up to 3 meters) even in noisy environments as it cancels point noise using two microphone input.
Onboard AI ASR Algorithms: Powered by XMOS XU-316 AI sound and audio chip, the kit includes Natural Language Understanding algorithms for Interference Cancellation (IC) , Acoustic Echo Cancellation, Noise Suppression, Voice-to-Noise Ratio (VNR), and Automatic Gain Control (AGC), enabling high quality voice capture.
Embracing Open Source：This board is compatible with popular hardware platforms (XIAO ESP32S3 (Sense), Adafruit QT Py) via I2S, and compatible with Raspberry Pi, PC via USB (Audio Class 2.0 (UAC2)).
Onboard RGB LED: the board features a programmable WS2812 RGB LED, supporting custom effects and offering a visual interface for your applications.
External Power Supply Support: this board supports external 5V power supply, which can be flexibly applied in different scenarios.
DFU for Custom Development: the board supports custom firmware update via DFU-Util.

Install DFU Util
dfu-util is a command line tool for Device Firmware Upgrade via USB port.

Windows
MacOS
Linux
Download dfu-util-0.11-binaries.tar.xz and extract it to your local system, e.g., D:\

Change directory to the dfu-util.exe
e.g., D:\dfu-util-0.11-binaries\win64(if you are using win32, please change win64 to win32)

Append the path of the dfu-util.exe to the system environment variable Path: My Computer > Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables > Path.
Please note that paths in the variable Path are seperated by semicolon ;. This will allow dfu-util to be executed globally in command prompt.

Open the start menu and type cmd. Press the enter key. In the terminal that comes up, check if dfu-util.exe path is set with dfu-util -V command:
